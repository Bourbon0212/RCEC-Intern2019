# RCEC-Intern2019
2019 Internship in Research Center for Environmental Changes

## Abstract
From our general knowledge, it’s easy to comprehend the climatic characteristics in Taiwan. For example, Taiwan is effected by distinct monsoons in different seasons, and its precipitation is highly dependent on spatial and temporal distribution. Therefore, this study attempts to adopt the perspective of data science, digs deep into the data from Central Weather Bureau (CWB), and sees whether it’s possible to find the similar features, through spatial and temporal clustering. Finally, the study has a little comparison between the clustering results and the present method.
